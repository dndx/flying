                    <p>The forms below are mainly directed at pilots in the club, however the operations handbook list club trip policies.</p>
                    <p><a href="docs/Flying_Cyclones_Operations_Handbook.pdf">Operations Handbook</a> - These are the rules for club trips. All club pilots must read and follow these rules. Failure to do so will result in loss of club flying privileges. If you have any questions or concerns, contact the club president.</p>

                    <p><a href="docs/Flying_Cyclones_Pilot_Participation_Agreement.pdf">Club Pilot Agreement</a> - Any pilot intending to fly as pilot in command on a club trip must first fill this out, acknowledging that he/she has read and agrees to follow the rules in the operations handbook. (Note that this form is in addition to the online insurance waiver required by the university)</p>

                    <p><a href="docs/weight_balance.xls">Weight and balance form</a> - As stated in the operations handbook, weight and balance must be computed prior to every flight. It does not need to be done using this form, but it must be done. You can use this Excel form if you wish. It will do some calculations for you. Fill in the white spaces with proper values. The light gray ones will be automatically calculated and the yellow ones will note whether the plane is within limits. The
                    pilot is responsible for double checking all calculations. A <a href="docs/weight_balance.pdf">pdf version</a> of the same form can be printed and filled in by hand.</p>
